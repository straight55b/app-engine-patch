We use [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/). Installers are available at http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryPackages

The project consists of multiple repositories for the various components:

  * sample project: http://bitbucket.org/gumptioncom/appenginepatch-sample/
  * modified Django version: http://bitbucket.org/gumptioncom/django-app-engine/
  * unmodified Django version (used to upgrade modified version): http://bitbucket.org/gumptioncom/django-original/

If you have an improvement please [contribute](Contributing.md). Most of the time you should send patches against our modified Django version.

If you simply want to use the latest sample project you only need to checkout the first repository.
